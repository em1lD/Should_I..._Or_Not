# Should_I..._Or_Not

This project helps people taking those silly decision that we don't wanna take because we know the right choice and don't want to make it, we really don't know which choice to do in a one or the other situation (like yes or no) OR you just want someone to confirm your choice.

It was also design with a twist to follow more human behavior in decision making, try to find the trick! (Or check the source code, that works too) Not a really elaborate one but in the futur I plan on adding more.

To try it out just download the html file and open it in a web browser.

Not totally finished, still want to improve every aspect of the program more.
